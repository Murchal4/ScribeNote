	Work Description:
		I'm a student majoring in Computer Science and game development. I want to gain experience by creating 			small Indie projects in order to get better at making video games and working with the community to 			enhance my tracking and social skills. I also want to try myself in crypto trading to earn myself some 			cash.

	Short Term Focus:
		I want to study how to code and model, as well as making small projects to actually try myself in coding 		and gain valuable experience. I also want to find time for myself to earn some additional income by doing 		crypto trading in order to have more financial stability.

	Long Term Goals:
		I want to create a couple of big game projects and release them on Steam. This will grant me extremely 			valuable experience and improve my skills, as well as providing me with some money.
		I also want to get comfortable in crypto trading to further more increase my income.

	Sorting Preferences:
		My top priority for now is to study and create small games in order to gain experience for my future big 		projects.
		My intermediate priority is to learn and do crypto to gain some money. It will motivate me and also help 		me with the finacnial struggles I might encounter.
		My least priority would be create big projects and release them. I still have a long journey and these 			skills are not the current objective. But they are a long term goal.
